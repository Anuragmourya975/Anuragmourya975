Hi👋, My name is Anurag Mourya, and thanks🙏 for checking my profile. I am a 3rd-year student pursuing a bachelor's🎓 in computer science from Mahakal Institute of technology & management🏢 Ujjain Madhyapradesh. I am a passionate learner who's always willing to learn and work across technologies👩‍💻 and domains. I love to explore new technologies and leverage them to solve real-life problems. I'm currently into Web Development and working on my Data Structures and Algorithm skills ( which is the backbone of any programming language ). I'm always ready to improve my programming skills and adopt new technologies.
